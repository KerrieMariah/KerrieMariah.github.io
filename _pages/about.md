Welcome to my world! I'm Kerrie Mariah, a passionate technologist, writer, mentor, and adventure seeker. My journey is as colorful and diverse as the code on a developer's screen. From the buzzing trade floors of corporate finance to the serenity of the Atlas mountains, from the competitive grounds of the University of Florida to the vibrant streets of Hong Kong, my life has been a tapestry of rich experiences and daring adventures.

### The Tech Enthusiast
Self-taught and endlessly curious, I dove headfirst into the world of programming. The journey wasn’t easy, but it was thrilling. Along the way, I've not only mastered the languages of computers but also learned the art of transforming complex, technical ideas into simple, elegant solutions. As a developer, I've tackled projects ranging from dynamic financial applications to creative web development, always with a keen eye for detail and a flair for innovation.

### The Storyteller
Every code tells a story, and I found my voice narrating them. Writing has been my companion since my younger days, a medium through which I decode and share my world. My experiences, from navigating love and loss to exploring the depths of different cultures, have shaped a writing style that is raw, authentic, and deeply human. Whether it's a technical piece, a poetic expression, or a captivating story, my writing aims to resonate, engage, and enlighten.

### The Mentor and Guide
Sharing knowledge is my passion, and mentoring is where my heart lies. Through my work with Springboard and interactions with students in Hong Kong, I've guided aspiring coders and tech enthusiasts, helping them discover their potential and navigate the digital world with confidence. I believe in a teaching approach that's interactive, fun, and tailored to individual needs – making learning an experience to cherish.

### The Adventurer
Life, for me, is an adventure – be it trekking in the Himalayas, diving in the Philippines, or immersing myself in the cultures of the places I've lived. These adventures fuel my creativity and infuse fresh perspectives into my professional endeavors.

### The Connective Thread
My life is a blend of tech, tales, teachings, and travels. Each aspect informs and enriches the other, making me who I am – a unique professional with a diverse skill set. On this site, you'll find a reflection of this blend: my projects, writings, and musings, all painting a picture of my journey.
