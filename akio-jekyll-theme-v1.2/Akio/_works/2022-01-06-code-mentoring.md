Hey there! I've spent countless hours getting my hands dirty in the world of coding and I know how difficult it can be starting out - especially if you're teaching yourself! But I have found so much joy in sharing what I've learned with others, including tips and tricks that give you a bit of an edge in hte competitive tech market.

### Mentoring the Next Wave of Coders

While in Hong Kong, I spent time with middle school students teaching them the basics of programming and the cyberworld of our computers. Through lessons on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I helped them in creating their first personalised websites, watching them light up as they customised every aspect of it. When it comes to learning a new skill, I believe in getting started on projects early as it leads to better understanding and creativity in the world of tech. Not to mention the twinkle in their eyes is priceless.

### Springboard Mentorship

Through the company Springboard, I've mentored upcoming tech enthusiasts of all ages, sharing insights, answering queries, and troubleshooting problems. The feedback? A stream of high ratings and gratitude from mentees. Each mentoring session for me is more than just a classâ€”it's a connection, a shared journey into the discovery of how to shape the cyber realm. 

### A Fresh Approach to Teaching

Forget the traditional, textbook-heavy learning. I like to shake things up. Whether it's using quirky analogies, setting up exciting challenges, or weaving in fun activities, my aim is to make tech not just understandable, but utterly captivating. Dive in with me, and let's explore the coding universe together!
