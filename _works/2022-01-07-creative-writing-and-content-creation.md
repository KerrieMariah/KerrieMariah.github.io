In today's day and age we've seen a recent influx of lazy writing in journalism, books, and online articles. I've noticed more grammatical errors, poor plot focus, and articles that lack any heartfelt feel. This will only increase with the advent of artificial intelligence like ChatGPT that is being used more and more to write quick articles for a cheap buck. In contrast, I offer a true all-human human service from the heart with a quick turnaround. I've been writing from a young age and continue to write almost daily as a passion of mine to express what I've learned and see in the world. 

> Through her prose, Kerrie Mariah masterfully captures the essence of human emotion and experience, effortlessly guiding readers on a journey that resonates deeply with the complexities of life. Her narrative is both authentic and evocative, revealing a talent for turning personal introspection into universally relatable tales

I've experienced a wide range of what life has to offer from medical training when I was getting my EMT license (including work in ambulances), to my five years in corporate finance, to striking out on my own to start my own company. I've been a competitive athlete at University of Florida competing all over the USA, worked in a four person startup while at an accelerator in New York City that was later bought out, <a href="https://www.seacrest.org/cf_news/view.cfm?newsid=12">lived with a rural farming village in the Atlas mountains of Morocco for a month</a>, bought a one way ticket to Hong Kong to start a new life there, lived through the Hong Kong protests and its harsh covid lockdown, have fallen in and out of love, was filmed on TV in Moscow speaking terrible Russian, have trekked for weeks in the Himalayas, traveled throughout China, wreck dived in the Philippines and have been hospitalised in over five different countries.It is from these experiences and many more (some that can't be published) that I draw from to write either raw and authentic material, or corporate and cryptic, I am a chamelion that can adapt to your company's needs.

The world of literature is as dynamic as any, with ever-changing themes, styles, and narratives. Drawing from my varied experiences, I ensure that my work is not just contemporary but timeless. Whether it's the structured world of finance, the unpredictability of medical emergencies, or the rhythmic flow of poetry, I blend these elements, crafting works that are both relatable and transcendent.
